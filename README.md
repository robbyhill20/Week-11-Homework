# Week-11-Notetaker
Note taker created to write and save notes. 
- Express . 
- Timer decreases by 10 seconds for ever incorrect answer. 
- In this project I gained a much better grasp of how to utilize javascript to create something that is a fun user experience. 
- Was not able to get the High Scores page to save** 
# Installation
 - Clone github repo https://github.com/robbyhill20/Week-11-Notetaker.git
 - NPM Install
 - Node> Server.js 
 - Once server is up and listening go to the local port in your browser (http://localhost:3000)

# Testing with Insomnia or Postman to verify paths are working 
- Also able to test this is working as expecting by using Insomnia or Postman to do GET and POST Request
- POST Request to http://localhost:3000/api/notes to see if you get "successful" returned 
- GET Request from  http://localhost:3000/api/notes should show the POST added to the list of previous notes.
